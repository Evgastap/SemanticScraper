# SemanticScraper

This is a collection of code that queries the list of top movies of 2020 from IMDB, scrapes that list, and formulates it in multiple XML files.

*main.py* - responsible for generating the main XML export, saves as *export.xml*

*main2.py* - responsible for generating the alternative, slightly-altered XML export, saved as *export2.xml*

**Other files** - not important or used as scratch. Please ignore.
